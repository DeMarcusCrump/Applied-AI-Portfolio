KEY FINDINGS
-------------------
Strengths:
  1. High precision (88.94%) - Few false positives
  2. Excellent detection of standard PPE (Hardhat: 85.2%, Safety Vest: 82.7%)
  3. Strong machinery and vehicle detection (84.1%, 81.0%)
  4. Robust to various lighting and angles (data augmentation effective)
  5. Real-time capable (66 FPS on GPU)

Areas for Improvement:
  1. Recall could be improved (68.87%) - some objects missed
  2. NO-Safety Vest detection challenging (71.3% mAP)
  3. NO-Mask detection lower (68.9% mAP) - possibly due to small object size
  4. Performance gap between PPE compliance vs violations (5-10%)

RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------
For Production Deployment:
  1. Use confidence threshold of 0.35-0.40 for safety-critical applications
  2. Implement multi-frame verification for video streams
  3. Add alert system for detected violations
  4. Regular model retraining with site-specific data
  5. Consider ensemble with YOLOv8m for higher accuracy if speed permits

For Model Improvement:
  1. Collect more examples of PPE violations (NO- classes)
  2. Implement Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) for +1-2% accuracy
  3. Experiment with higher resolution (800x800 or 1024x1024)
  4. Fine-tune on specific construction site data
  5. Consider YOLOv8m variant for 3-5% accuracy boost

CONCLUSION
-------------------
The YOLOv8s PPE detection system achieves strong performance with 77.1% mAP@50 
and 88.94% precision on the test set. The model is production-ready for 
real-time workplace safety monitoring. High precision ensures reliable violation 
detection with minimal false alarms, while moderate recall suggests some violations 
may be missed. The system performs best on standard PPE items (hardhats, vests) 
and context objects (cones, machinery, vehicles).

For critical safety applications, recommend deploying with appropriate confidence 
thresholds and implementing multi-frame verification to reduce false negatives.
