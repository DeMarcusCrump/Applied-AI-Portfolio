  - Speed: 15ms per image (2000x faster)
  - Accuracy: 77.1% mAP@50
  - Precision: 88.94% (few false alarms)
  - Scalability: Unlimited (batch processing)

Improvement:
  - 2000x faster processing
  - 12% higher accuracy than fatigued manual inspection
  - Consistent performance (no fatigue)
  - Real-time capable for video monitoring

KEY FINDINGS
-------------------
Strengths:
  - High precision (88.94%) minimizes false positives
  - Excellent detection of standard PPE (Hardhat: 85.2%, Safety Vest: 82.7%)
