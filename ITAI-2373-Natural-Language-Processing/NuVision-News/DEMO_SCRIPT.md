## INTRODUCTION (20 seconds)
**All Speakers Together:**

"Hi everyone! We're Team NuVision - [Name], [Name], and [Name]. Today we're demoing NuVision News, our NLP-powered intelligent news platform. Each of us will walk you through different features. Let's jump in."

---

## SPEAKER 1: DASHBOARD, AI SUMMARY & DEEP DIVE MODE (2 minutes)

**Speaker 1:**

"I'll start with the main dashboard and article intelligence features.

[SHOW HOMEPAGE]

Here's our homepage with over 2,000 pre-processed articles. Each card shows sentiment badges, category tags, source info, publication date, and our Daily Brief Score - that's our algorithm ranking article importance.

[SCROLL THROUGH FEED]

Let me click on an article...

[CLICK AN ARTICLE]

Here's the article page. Watch this - I'll generate an AI summary.

[CLICK 'GENERATE AI SUMMARY', WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

Boom! A 1,200-word article condensed into three sentences using the Hugging Face transformer model. This is abstractive summarization - the AI understands and rewrites, not just extracts.

Now Deep Dive mode...

[CLICK 'DEEP DIVE' OR NAVIGATE TO DEEP DIVE]

This gives you a complete intelligence breakdown. The Knowledge Graph shows automatically extracted entities - blue circles are people, green are organizations, orange are locations, purple are events. The connections show relationships.

[SCROLL DOWN]

And here's the Event Timeline - chronological view of how the story developed over time with key dates and events.

That's the dashboard, AI summaries, and Deep Dive. Now I'll pass it to [Speaker 2's name]."

## SPEAKER 2: BIAS RADAR & SOURCE ANALYSIS (2 minutes)

**Speaker 2:**

"Thanks! I'll show you our Bias Radar for media literacy.

[NAVIGATE TO BIAS RADAR PAGE]

The Bias Radar visualizes source diversity and political leanings across coverage. 

[POINT TO VISUALIZATION]

This chart shows which sources are covering a topic and where they fall politically. See this example? 8 different sources - left-leaning, center, and right-leaning all represented. That's balanced coverage.

[POINT TO DIFFERENT EXAMPLE]

Now look at this - only 3 sources, all from one political side. That's your echo chamber warning.

The Bias Radar shows sentiment variance, source credibility scores, and coverage intensity.

[CLICK A SOURCE]

Click any source to see all their articles, sentiment distribution, and compare to other sources.

[CLICK ON AN ARTICLE WITH CLUSTER]

When you view related articles, the Bias Radar updates to show diversity across that cluster. This cluster has 6 different sources with varied political leanings - comprehensive coverage.

It's about transparency and media literacy - showing you when you're in a filter bubble. Now let me hand it to [Speaker 3's name] for Topics and Audio."

---

## SPEAKER 3: TOPICS FEATURE & AUDIO (2 minutes)

**Speaker 3:**

"Perfect! I'll show you Topics and our Audio feature.

[NAVIGATE TO HOMEPAGE]

See this 'Topics' menu? This filters through our 2,000+ articles.

[CLICK TOPICS MENU]

We have six categories: Technology, Politics, Business, Health, Entertainment, and Sports.

[SELECT TECHNOLOGY]

Instant filtering - only tech news now. All 2,000 articles filtered in real-time.

[SELECT POLITICS FROM TOPICS]

Switch to Politics - instant again. The filtering works with all features - sentiment analysis, Daily Brief Scores, everything updates.

You can combine with search too. Watch - 'climate policy'...

[TYPE IN SEARCH]

Only political articles about climate policy. Semantic search, not just keywords.

Now the Audio feature - perfect for on-the-go.

[NAVIGATE TO AUDIO PAGE]

Audio page converts articles to speech. Select an article...

[SELECT ARTICLE, CLICK PLAY]

Listen - that's the summary read aloud in natural text-to-speech. 

[LET PLAY, THEN PAUSE]

You can adjust playback speed, change voices, and create playlists. Huge for accessibility - stay informed while commuting or exercising.

That covers Topics and Audio. Those are the core features of NuVision News!"
